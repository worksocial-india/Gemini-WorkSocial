# Google Search Console Setup Guide

## ✅ Site Ownership Already Verified via Google Analytics

Your site is already verified through Google Analytics integration. You can skip the manual verification step!

## Step 1: Access Google Search Console

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Sign in with the same Google account used for Google Analytics
3. Your property `worksocial.in` should already be listed
4. If not, add it - verification will be automatic via Google Analytics

## Step 2: Submit Your Sitemap (DO THIS NOW!)

After accessing your property:
1. In Search Console, go to "Sitemaps" (left sidebar)
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click "Submit"
4. Wait for Google to process (can take a few hours to days)

**Your Sitemap URL:** `https://worksocial.in/sitemap.xml`

## Step 3: Request Indexing for Key Pages

1. Go to "URL Inspection" tool
2. Enter important URLs one by one:
   - `https://worksocial.in/`
   - `https://worksocial.in/calculators`
   - `https://worksocial.in/calculators/emi`
   - `https://worksocial.in/calculators/sip`
   - `https://worksocial.in/services`
3. Click "Request Indexing" for each

## Step 4: Monitor Your Performance

1. Check "Performance" report after a few days
2. Look for:
   - Total clicks
   - Total impressions
   - Average CTR
   - Average position
3. Fix any coverage issues in the "Coverage" report
